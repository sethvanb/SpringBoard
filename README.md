# SpringBoard Capstone Project

## Project Description
The idea I settled on was a machine learning model to help people bet on sports. To do this the model will be trained on a teams previous schedule and the resulting score for each game. Then when a new season starts some one can use an api to input a specific game and it will return a predict score range for both teams playing. This will aid in betting when deciding what teams to bet on and weather they want to take the spread or moneyline.
